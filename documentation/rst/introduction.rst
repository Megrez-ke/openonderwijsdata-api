The OpenOnderwijs API contributes to these goals by providing a unified interface to data on education collected from several institutions with different responsibilities with regard to the Dutch educational system, such as `DUO <http://data.duo.nl>`_, `Onderwijsinspectie <http://www.owinsp.nl>`_ and `Vensters voor Verantwoording <http://schoolvo.nl>`_.
